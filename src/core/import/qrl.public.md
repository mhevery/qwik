# `QRL`

`QRL` type represents a lazy loadable AND serializable resource.

QRL stands for Qwik URL.

Use `QRL` when you want to refer to a lazy loaded resource. `QRL`s are most often used for code (functions) but can also be used for other resources such as `string`s in the case of styles.

`QRL` is an opaque token which is generated by the Qwik Optimizer. (Do not rely on any properties in `QRL` as it may change between versions.)

## Creating `QRL` references

Creating `QRL` is done using `$(...)` function. `$(...)` is a special marker for the Qwik Optimizer that marks that the code should be extracted into a lazy loaded symbol.

<docs code="./qrl.examples.tsx#qrl-usage-$"/>

In the above code the Qwik Optimizer detects `$(...)` and transforms the code as shown below:

<docs code="./qrl.examples.tsx#qrl-usage-$-optimized"/>

NOTE: `qrl(...)` is a result of Qwik Optimizer transformation. You should never have to invoke this function directly in your application. The `qrl(...)` function should be invoked only after Qwik Optimizer transformation.

## Using `QRL`s

Use `QRL` type in your application when you want to get a lazy loadable reference to a resource (most likely a function.)

<docs code="./qrl.examples.tsx#qrl-usage-type"/>

In the above example the way to think about the code is that you are not asking for a callback function, but rather a reference to a lazy loadable call back function. Specifically the function loading should be delayed until it is actually needed. In the above example the function would not load until after a `mousemove` event on `document` fires.

## Resolving `QRL` references

At times it may be need to resolve a `QRL` reference to the actual value. This can be performed using `qrlImport(..)` function.

<docs code="./qrl.examples.tsx#qrl-usage-import"/>

NOTE: `element` is needed because `QRL`s are relative and need base location to resolve against. The base location is encoded in the HTML in the form of `<div q:base="/url">`.

## Question: Why not just use `import()`?

At first glance `QRL` serves the same purpose as `import()`. However there are three subtle differences which need to be taken into account.

1. `QRL`s must be serializable into HTML.
2. `QRL`s must be resolved by framework relative to `q:base`.
3. `QRL`s must be able to capture lexically scoped variables.
4. `QRL`s encapsulate difference between running with and without Qwik Optimizer.
5. `QRL`s allow expressing lazy loaded boundary without thinking about chunk and symbol names.

Let's assume that you intend to write code such as this:

```typescript
return <button onClick={() => (await import('./chunk-abc.js')).onClick}>
```

The above code needs to be serialized into DOM such as:

```
<div q:base="/build/">
  <button on:click="./chunk-abc.js#onClick">...</button>
</div>
```

1. Notice there is no easy wat to extract chunk (`./chunk-abc.js`) and symbol (`onClick`) into HTML.
2. Notice that even if you could extract it, the `import('./chunk-abc.js')` would become relative to where the `import()` file is declared. Because it is our framework doing the load, the `./chunk-abc.js` would become relative to the framework file. This is not correct, as it should be relative to the original file generated by the bundler.
3. Next the framework needs to resolve the `./chunk-abc.js` and needs a base location which is encoded in the HTML.
4. The QRL needs to be able to capture lexically scoped variables. (`import()` only allows loading top level symbol which don't capture variables.)
5. As a developer you don't want to think about `import` and naming of the chunks and symbols. You just want to say, this should be lazy.

The above are the main reasons why Qwik introduces its own concept of `QRL`.

See: `$`

@public

# `qrlImport`

Lazy load a `QRL` symbol and return the lazy loaded value value.

See: `QRL`

@param element - Location of the URL to resolve against. This is needed to take `q:base` into account.
@param qrl - QRL to load.
@returns A resolved QRL value as a Promise.
@public

# `$`

Qwik Optimizer marker function.

Use `$(...)` to tell Qwik Optimizer to extract the expression in `$(...)` into a lazy loadable resource referenced by `QRL`.

See: `implicit$FirstArg` for additional `____$(...)` rules.

In this example `$(...)` is used to capture the callback function of `onmousemove` into lazy loadable reference. This allows the code to refer to the function without actually loading the function. In this example the callback function does not get loaded until `mousemove` event fires.

<docs code="./qrl.examples.tsx#qrl-usage-$"/>

In the above code the Qwik Optimizer detects `$(...)` and transforms the code as shown below:

<docs code="./qrl.examples.tsx#qrl-usage-$-optimized"/>

## Special Rules

The Qwik Optimizer places special rules on functions which can be lazy loaded.

1. The expression of the `$(expression)` function must be importable by the system. (expression shows up in `import` or has `export`)
2. If inlined function then all lexically captured values must be:
   - importable (vars shows up in `import` or has `export`)
   - const (the capturing process differs from JS capturing in that writing to captured variables does not update them, and therefore writes are forbidden. Best practice is that all captured variables are constants.)
   - Must be runtime serializable.

<docs code="./qrl.examples.tsx#qrl-capturing-rules"/>

@param expression
@public

# `implicit$FirstArg`

Create a `____$(...)` convenience method from `___(...)`.

It is very common for functions to take lazy-loadable resource as a first argument. For this reason QwikOptimizer automatically extracts first argument from any function which ends in `$`.

This means that `foo$(arg0)` and `foo($(arg0))` are equivalent with respect to Qwik Optimizer. The former is just a short hand for latter.

For example all of these function call are equivalent:

- `component$(() => {...})` is same as `onRender($(() => {...}))`
- `onRender$(() => <>...</>)` is same as `onRender($(() => <>...</>))`

<docs code="./qrl.examples.tsx#implicit$FirstArg"/>

@param fn
@public

# `qrl`

Used by Qwik Optimizer to point to lazy loaded resources.

This function should be used by the Qwik Optimizer only. The function should not be directly refereed to in source code of application.
